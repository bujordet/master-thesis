\chapter{Discussion} \label{cha:discussion}
This chapter discuss the questions on the research question, and discuss the results. Using knowledge from both the litterature review and the case study. This discussion will give the foundation for the conclusion and further work discussed in chapter \ref{cha:conclusion}. 

This project thesis tries to identify the fundamental reason for the striking difference in LP between the ICT-industry and CI, in a project utilizing lean methodology and software supporting it. The results indicate that the use of tools as lean and groupware is not as helpful as hoped, due to reduced utilization. The indication for poor LP identified in the LSB-project has a basis in the interaction between the workers, where a lack of understanding and unsure responsibility are a significant impact on the projects productivity. 

This result suggests the reason for the striking difference in LP. This chapter will discuss this result around the three key themes identified in the analysis of the interview data. Furthermore, look at different approaches defeating these issues, as well as look at the limitations of this thesis.
