\noindent This master thesis is of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and written in the spring of 2020. This thesis follows a pre-master project, completed in the fall of 2016, which included a smaller empirical project and a literature review. This thesis collects all the knowledge obtained in the first phase, combined with a more extensive empirical study. 

There are a few people who enabled me to write this thesis. First of all, I would like to thank all those who participated in the study. I do not wish to print their names due to anonymization, but they know who they are, and they all have my deepest gratitude. Thank you. Second, I would like to thank Patrick Stormo Hjerpseth, who helped me get in touch with Statsbygg, who eventually is responsible for giving me access to the data I needed.

Last, my gratitude goes to my supervisor Eric Monteiro, who has given me helpful tips, feedback, and guidance for me to produce this research. Without his pointers, I would never manage to complete this thesis.
